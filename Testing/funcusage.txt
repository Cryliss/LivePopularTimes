these are the only ones you really have to care about




get_places_by_search(query):

no api calls, just returns place ids and stuff. 
May be used with combination with get_populartimes_from_search(place_identifier, get_detail=False)
to make an api-less crawler for populartimes. 


get_populartimes_by_place_id(api_key, place_id):
parses and runs bs to get a clean copy of what get_populartimes_from_search will give you

feel free to play around

i really want to make this all into a clas later
